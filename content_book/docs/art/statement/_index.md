# Artist's statement

As an artist in the [new media art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art) environment I explore the relationship between man and technology. I’m interested in artificial intelligence (especially in relationship with our sense of consciousness and life), the possibilities of open-source/open-hardware, open data banks and the information that users shares by mistake.

In turn, I work with [intuitive photography](http://fransimo.info/en/blog/2009/01/01/fotografia-intuitiva/). This [drifting](http://fransimo.info/en/blog/2015/03/15/traces-personal-drifts/) helps me capture the essence of spaces, places or situations using the city as an enormous plateau. I photograph anonymous people, urban details or insignificant spaces in order to transport them into a different space/time with the intention to create new stories. This way, (frozen) time and (georeferenced) space turn into key aspects of my photographs that I continually save to create a time capsule. My images occupy ludic terrain, often captured in a meditative state that is articulated as a game of exploring the subconscious.

I present my work organized in series of images as installations, photobooks… or by creating environments where photographs are shown accompanied by video and/or music. During the development of my trajectory, I’ve explored participative and collaborative processes that turn into a way of getting together in order to create communities and to promote photography as a means of individual and group artistic expression. At the same time, I have organized exhibitions, debates, publications, marketing campaigns, etc.

## Motivation

Being an artist is an addiction even a moral obligation. Once you discover you can lighten up an emotion with the stroke of a brush, an idea, a smile, a teardrop or shake someone up. You can change the brush, the canvas and the instrument, but once you start this course, it is impossible to understand life without walking it down.

Art is plastic thought. A swing between ideas and aesthetics. The beauty of a piece is a chasm in the walls of the cavern. If while creating it vibrates, the wave would find its chords and it will shake the world.

The signature and date are an accident that might only help us understand how that people were able to be in tune, vibrate and sing in their tongues, ages and places. If they did, their waves would not have date.

Even thought the journey is not the destination, we know ‘at the end of the course there is always a mirror’. Once we start walking we need to keep on because in the end we will only find ourselves.
