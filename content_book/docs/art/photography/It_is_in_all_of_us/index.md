# It is in all of us

“DIFFERENT PEOPLE make journeys for different reasons. Sometimes they’re forced; sometimes they think they choose.”
— In the Dark Places of Wisdom, Peter Kingsley [p.15]

*"It Is in All of Us"* is an ongoing research project that explores the connection between art and magic, tracing a path
through the Sibyls, the Maenads, the ancient feminine cults, and the healing practices of the Iatromantis to help us
remember our magical origins. It takes the form of both an inner and outer journey.

Since the beginning of my journey into spirituality and magic, I have always heard a whisper:
“It doesn’t come from India… it doesn’t come from Japan… it’s not Celtic… nor Tibetan… nor from an American tribe… it is
within all of us.”

Magical tradition has always existed within us. And it will always resurface. No matter how many times they hunt us as
witches, it will resurface because it is inherent to being human.

It comes from our hearts, from the stars, from the original sound that resonates in everything: “It is in all of us”.
