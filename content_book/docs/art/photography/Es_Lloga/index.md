# Es lloga (For Rent)

2009-2010

> _“Unemployment keeps rising in Spain, punishing with the most cruelty small and medium-seize businesses. It is estimated that every day 500 independent contractors lose their jobs and every week about 4000 businesses are forced to close. The small and medium-size Catalan companies will demonstrate again tomorrow before the Congress…”_ (11-17-2009 “La Vanguardia” Newspaper. Barcelona. )

The closure of thousands of small businesses is only one facet of a more complex drama. Every store that closes affects its owner, its employees, its providers and all of their families. 

Every one of these doors holds the dreams stolen by a financial cataclysm. The entities responsible for it don’t have a name nor can be blamed or punished. <strong>All those dreams are now available “for rent”.</strong>

Capitalism, in its pure state, inspires the spirit of entrepreneurship and creativity, courage, stability and the value of exchange. As a result of this spirit, wealth, employment, technology and well-being are produced. On the other hand, greed, opulence, lack of ethics and selfishness destroy it. 

This crisis is not a result of an external attack. There is no enemy. We, ourselves, have set the bomb. In order for capitalism to be sustainable, there must be a balance between the creative spirit and greed. 

The mechanisms of the system’s self-control didn’t work. Nobody listened to the analysts when they warned that the cycle of quick high-risk profit would backfire.

Every time I though about the crisis and its responsible I remember that Bruce Springsteen’s words in Youngstown “Once I made you rich enough, rich enough to forget my name”
