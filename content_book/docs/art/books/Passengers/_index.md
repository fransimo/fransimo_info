# Passengers

Passengers is a street photography project, in both web and book series form, about anonymous public transport
passengers. It’s designed as a participative online project. All the images are captured by mobile devices and published
on Instagram. The site is a “real-time view” of the participation process. The book is a visual meditation on public
transport passengers and the aesthetics of street photography using mobile devices.

[From the Kodak Brownie to the iPhone](From_the_Kodak_Brownie_to_the_iPhone) is a text I wrote for the book.

It’s available in printed and various ebook formats:
