# Code  

In 1985, at the age of 11, I studied [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). That same year, I ended up teaching other children.  

In 1991, at 17, I was selling _custom software_ to local merchants, programming in Basic and Cobol (we all have a past ðŸ¤ª).  

Between 1992 and 1998, I studied Information Systems Engineering at the National Technological University, CÃ³rdoba Regional Faculty.  

I combined my studies with work as an _administrative assistant_ and freelance consultant, mainly in networking and communications, but also developing software projects, some even in assembly language.  

In 1995, I took my first machine learning courses as a student member of the IEEE: neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. I applied some of these ideas in my thesis, where I used heuristics based on georeferencing to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.  

In 1998, I started a Master's in Software Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and began my career in multinational companies.  

After a few years programming in Visual Basic, I started leading small development teams. I was particularly interested in Release Management processes, code management, and version control.  

By 2004, I was already working in the Java ecosystem, though focusing on version control, continuous integration, and what, a few years later, would be called DevOps.  

After 10 years working for clients such as Banc Sabadell, Gas Natural, and the tax agencies of Catalonia and the Canary Islands, I left Barcelona to move to Palma and start the most exciting chapter of my engineering career at Hotelbeds.  

During my 10 years there, I built a team and processes for Release Management. I led the QA team of nearly 40 people, spread across four countries (Spain, the UK, Israel, and Romania).  
I helped overhaul test automation, integrating it with the CICD pipeline in a complex microservices system distributed across multiple data centers.  

In 2018, I received an offer to return to the architecture teams, which I accepted. This allowed me to work as a Solution Architect for the Applied Science team, specializing in data-driven decision-making, big data, and machine learning.  

I even spent a few years on the Enterprise Architects team, always working in the data world.  

The year 2024 brought many changes and decisions. In February, I founded [Unity Labs SL](https://unity-labs.eu/), a legal framework that allows me to develop a new way to contribute to the world with my knowledge, skills, and experience.  

**After more than 30 years in the software industry, I am convinced that software is deeply human.**  

Creating software that truly helps people requires technical knowledge, but above all, it demands communication between professionals from different fields, attention to detail, and the ability to manage changeâ€”both in software and organizations.  

Over the years, **I have come to see myself as a translator**. Ensuring that all the people involved work together so that a single line of code does what it should in a production environment is, at its core, a translation task.  

Translating business needs into a model, translating that model into a set of artifacts with different functions, converting that architecture into code, and ensuring that the code moves through testing and promotion processes until it reaches the client. Finally, translating all of this into clear communication with users so they can successfully interact with the software.
