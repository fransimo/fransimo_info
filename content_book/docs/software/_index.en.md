# Code

In 1985, at the age of 11, I was studying [Logo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(lenguaje_de_programaci%C3%B3n)). That same year I ended up teaching other children.

In 1991, at 17, I was selling _custom software_ to merchants in my city, programming in Basic and Cobol (we all have a past ðŸ¤ª).

Between 1992 and 1998, I studied Information Systems Engineering at the National Technological University, CÃ³rdoba Regional Faculty.

I combined my studies with my work as an _administrator_ and freelance consultant, mainly in networks and communication, although I also developed some software projects, even in assembly language.

In 1995, I took my first machine learning courses as a student member of IEEE: neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. I applied some ideas in my final project, where I used heuristics based on georeferencing to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.

In 1998, I started the Master's in Software Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and my career in multinational companies.

After a few years programming in Visual Basic, I started leading small development teams. I became particularly interested in Release Management processes, code management, and versioning.

In 2004, I was already in the Java world, although focused on version management, continuous integration, and what, a few years later, would be called DevOps.

After 10 years working for clients such as Banc Sabadell, Gas Natural, and the tax agencies of Catalonia and the Canary Islands, I left Barcelona to move to Palma and start the most interesting chapter of my career as an engineer at Hotelbeds.

During the 10 years I was there, I organized a team and its Release Management processes. I led the QA team, with nearly 40 people working from four countries (Spain, United Kingdom, Israel, and Romania).  
I contributed to the renewal of the testing automation, integrating it with CICD in a complex system of microservices distributed across multiple Data Centers.

In 2018, I received an offer to return to architecture teams and accepted it. It allowed me to work as a Solution Architect for the Applied Science team, specializing in data-driven decisions, big data, and machine learning.

I even spent some years in the Enterprise Architects team, always linked to the data world.

2024 was a year of many changes and decisions. In February, I created the company [Unity Labs SL](https://unity-labs.eu/), a legal framework that allows me to develop a new way to contribute to the world with my knowledge, skills, and experience.

**After more than 30 years in the software industry, I am clear that software is something profoundly human.**

Creating software that truly helps people requires technical knowledge, but above all, it demands communication between professionals from different fields, attention to detail, and the ability to manage change, both in software and organizations.

Throughout these years, **I have come to see myself as a translator**. Getting all the people involved to work together so that a line of code does what it should in a productive environment is, essentially, a translation job.

Translating what the business needs into a model, translating that model into a set of artifacts with different functions, turning that architecture into code, and ensuring that line of code travels all the way to the client through testing and promotion processes between environments. Finally, translating all of the above into clear communication with the user so they can successfully use the software.

If you think I can help you with your project, [get in touch](../contact). We will surely find a way to make people understand each other and end up writing code that drives the success of your project.
