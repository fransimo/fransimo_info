# Types of Sessions and Prices  

If you’re not looking for a specific technique and we can have an in-person session, I would start with Craniosacral Biodynamics. This technique combines subtlety, touch, listening, and relaxation.  

If we can't meet in the same space-time, I recommend a Tameana session.  

If you’re here for Tantra, before the massage, we would have a preliminary session to get to know each other and determine what suits you best. We could also do a few guidance sessions. Don’t forget to check out the [Tantra exploration resources on the blog](../../posts/2024/07/recursos_aprendizaje.md).  

The sessions are arranged from the most subtle to the most physical:  

## Tameana  

Tameana is a vibrational healing practice that uses quartz crystals and channeled symbols to work on the energetic body. I practice the Salush Nahí technique (energetic balancing for a person) and H’ama (harmonization of a space or unlocking a situation). [Read more here](tameana.md).  

- **Duration:** 1 hour.  
- **Setting:** chair, massage table, or tatami.  
- **Price:**  
    - Salush Nahí: €60  
    - H’ama: €30  
- **Location:** remote, at your place, or a rented space.  

## Craniosacral Biodynamics  

Craniosacral Biodynamics aims to restore the body's inherent health by awakening its natural healing capacity. [Read more here](biodinamica_craneosacral.md).  

- **Duration:** 1 hour.  
- **Setting:** massage table.  
- **Price:** €60  
- **Location:** at your place or a rented space.  

## Holistic Session  

These sessions combine various massage and energy techniques, adapting them to each person and situation. [Read more here](masaje_holistico.md).  

- **Duration:** 1 hour.  
- **Setting:** chair, massage table, or tatami.  
- **Price:** €60  
- **Location:** remote, public spaces, at your place, or a rented space.  

## Relaxing Massage  

Using different massage techniques, I aim to relax your body and mind with no other energetic or therapeutic intention beyond relaxation itself.  

- **Duration:** 30 minutes.  
- **Setting:** massage table or tatami.  
- **Price:** €40  
- **Location:** at your place or a rented space.  

## Tantra Guidance  

I am not a Tantra master, but I have walked part of the path. If you don’t feel comfortable attending a retreat, we can explore some practices together to help you approach Tantra through meditation and a little, very little, theory.  

- **Duration:** 60 minutes.  
- **Setting:** massage table or tatami.  
- **Price:** €40  
- **Location:** remote, at your place, or a rented space.  

## Tantric Massage  

Before starting, it’s important that we agree on a framework to avoid misunderstandings.  
In [this link](masaje_tantrico.md), you can read about my approach to Tantric massage.  

- **Duration:** 3 hours.  
- **Setting:** tatami.  
- **Price:** €180  
- **Location:** at your place or a rented space.

# Service Limitations  

**I am not a psychologist.** I have studied massage techniques and consider myself a massage therapist. Through my training, I have experienced things that may help others and go beyond traditional massage, but I do not provide psychological therapy.  

**During the sessions, we work with energy, but we do not control it.** Certain processes (such as trauma release) may be triggered, requiring professional emotional support. If this happens and you don’t have a therapist, I can recommend trusted professionals who work in-person in Mallorca or remotely in Spanish, Catalan, English, and Russian.
