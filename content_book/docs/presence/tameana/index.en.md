# Tameana  

Tameana is a vibrational healing practice that **uses quartz crystals and channeled symbols to work on the energy body**. It is based on the idea of raising a person's vibrational frequency to unblock emotions, release stagnant energies, and facilitate internal transformation processes.  

It has its roots in the Pleiadian tradition and was spread by Juan Manuel Giordano. The practice involves placing quartz crystals in specific positions around the body, combined with mantras and sacred geometry. Additionally, it has the unique feature of being performed remotely.  

After attending three retreats in Montserrat with Juan, I trained with [Angelica Alercia](https://www.instagram.com/angelica.alercia.ser/) in 2024.  

I practice two of its techniques:  

- **Salush Nahí**: Sessions for complete system harmonization and physical, emotional, and mental healing. It awakens and connects the intelligence of the entire Being, balancing the chakras. Offered in both individual and group sessions.  
- **H’ama**: Energetic cleansing of spaces. It clears stagnant energies that may be densifying and blocking homes, businesses, etc. Instead, it raises the vibration to optimize the space’s function.
