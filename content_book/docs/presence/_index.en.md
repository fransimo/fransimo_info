I have been giving massages since childhood. I have learned and continue to learn techniques, but **the essence is to touch with neutrality from the heart** and surrender to that _something_ we cannot comprehend, yet which guides us at all times.

During the massage, my work is to open myself and become a channel so that the will of our beings may manifest here and now.

From the most subtle, like [tameana](tameana.md) and [craniosacral biodynamics](biodinamica_craneosacral.md), to 
[tantric massage](masaje_tantrico.md), we can explore paths to expand your awareness, remind your body 
how to restore its inherent health, or simply find a moment of peace.

If you feel the calling, you can check out the [services and prices](precios.md) and [contact me](../contact).

**May our hearts illuminate the path!**
