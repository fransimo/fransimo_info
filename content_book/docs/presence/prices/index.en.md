# Types of Sessions and Prices  

If you’re not looking for a specific technique and we can have an in-person session, I would start with Craniosacral Biodynamics. This technique combines subtlety, touch, listening, and relaxation.  

If we can't meet in the same space-time, I recommend a Tameana session.  

The sessions are arranged from the most subtle to the most physical:  

## Tameana  

Tameana is a vibrational healing practice that uses quartz crystals and channeled symbols to work on the energetic body. I practice the Salush Nahí technique (energetic balancing for a person) and H’ama (harmonization of a space or unlocking a situation). [Read more here](tameana/).  

- **Duration:** 1 hour.  
- **Setting:** chair, massage table, or tatami.  
- **Price:**  
    - Salush Nahí: €60  
    - H’ama: €30  
- **Location:** remote, at your place, or a rented space.  

## Craniosacral Biodynamics  

Craniosacral Biodynamics aims to restore the body's inherent health by awakening its natural healing capacity. [Read more here](biodinamica_craneosacral/).  

- **Duration:** 1 hour.  
- **Setting:** massage table.  
- **Price:** €60  
- **Location:** at your place or a rented space.  

## Holistic Session  

These sessions combine various massage and energy techniques, adapting them to each person and situation. [Read more here](masaje_holistico/).  

- **Duration:** 1 hour.

- **Price:** €60  
- **Location:** remote, public spaces, at your place, or a rented space.  


# Service Limitations  

**I am not a psychologist.** I have studied massage techniques and consider myself a massage therapist and energy channeler. Throughout my training, I have had experiences that may help others and go beyond traditional massage, but I do not offer psychological therapy in any form.  

**In these sessions, we work with energy, but we do not control it.** Internal processes (such as trauma release) may be activated, requiring emotional support from a professional. If this is your case and you do not have a therapist, I can recommend trusted professionals who work in person in Mallorca, as well as others who offer remote sessions in Spanish, Catalan, English, and Russian.  

It is important to remember that massage and energetic techniques can complement and integrate with other medical treatments, but **they should not replace consultation with a healthcare professional**.  

**Each person is responsible for their own process.** Healing is an individual journey, and experiences may vary. Specific results are not guaranteed, as energy work acts uniquely in each case.  

**Contraindications:** These sessions are not recommended for individuals with severe psychiatric conditions without medical supervision, nor in cases of acute crisis. If in doubt, please consult a healthcare professional.
