[Rainy Day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/summerfeelings/3030122090/) as flickrGrama.

This is a procjet i’m working **flickrGramas**.

It’s a very early version, my first try. Next improvements are  
1) use only cc drivates allowed  
2) create by tags (a face formed by thousands of faces, a rainy day formed by thousands of rainy images)  
3) improve color indexing technics
