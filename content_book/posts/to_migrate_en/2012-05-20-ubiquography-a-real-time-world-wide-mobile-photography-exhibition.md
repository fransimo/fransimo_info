Ubiquography is an exhibition that aims to make people think about <strong>the traits that define mobile photography: ubiquity and immediacy</strong>.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ubiquography.com/">http://ubiquography.com/</a></p>
Participants capture, edit and publish their pictures using their phones and they are instantly displayed in the exhibition (inreal-time) emphasizing the immediacy aspect.

The exhibition will be simultaneously held in different cities around the world, in very diverse and distant locations, making the exhibition ubiquitous.

<strong>Mobile networked photography can't be explained like traditional photography. A bunch of prints on a wall will never be able to explain to the public what this new photographic paradigm really means.</strong> Our full statement can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/Ac0rQG">here</a>

The exhibition will take place from May 24 to June 8 on 29 venues around the world. Barcelona, Beirut, Kiev and Buenos Aires are just some of the cities hosting the exhibition. The full list can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/IiDNBW">here</a> and more venues are being added each day.

We now have 30.000+ pictures from over 50 countries and 1000 cities from 500+ authors! <a href="http://bit.ly/JE9sPh">map</a>

The website is operating since January 2012, receiving and showing works made using a mobile phone and Instagram.
