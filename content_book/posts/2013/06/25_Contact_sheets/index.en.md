As part of my Artificial Intelligence research I made this contact sheets of the faces that the algorithm is finding.
You can read more about my research [here](/docs/art/new_media_art/I_dreamed_about_a_human_being/).

You can also view the full contact sheets archive in [contacts](http://contact-sheets-idahb.fransimo.info/)
or [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/93211492@N06/). The archive is updated every time the system find
enough number of new faces.

Note that every picture is credited, this is not appropriation of images on internet, it's re-use of freely distributed
content interpreted my an AI algorithm.
