# Craniosacral Biodynamics

It is an extremely subtle, non-intrusive, gentle, and effective bodywork approach that combines scientific techniques
with intuition and sensitivity, within a space of meditative awareness.

Craniosacral biodynamics is based on the principle of the "Breath of Life": the vital force that connects us to our
origin, to inherent health, to the source of being and wholeness, where there is no separation.

The Breath of Life is an ordering force expressed in a slow, constant, and cyclical movement called the "Tide" or "
Primary Respiration," the manifestation of life itself from conception.

Training in this discipline allows practitioners to perceive primary respiration, or the "Tides," and use them as a
basis for evaluation and treatment.

I'm studying at [Spanish Institute of Craniosacral Biodynamics](https://biodinamicacraneosacral.org/es/que-es-2/). My
teachers approach combines the views of Andrew Taylor Still, William G. Sutherland, Rollin Becker, James S. Jealous,
John Upledger, Franklyn Sills and Ray Castelino.
