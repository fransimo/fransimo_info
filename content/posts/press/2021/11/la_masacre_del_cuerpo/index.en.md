As part of City Screen at the [Loop Festival in Barcelona](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025225315/https://loop-barcelona.com/es/feria-loop-2021-2/), the [Ideograma Foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20211026003857/https://fundacion.ideograma.org/) presents the **video art exhibition: “The Massacre of the Body.”**

This exhibition revolves around **the construction of post-capitalist bodies,** those that struggle to end the massacre imposed by systems of control and surplus value, inscribed within them.

The selection of videos by various artists explores ways to **decongest corporeality and reclaim the intensities crushed** by phallocentrism, the identity of the image, or the construction of a self that dances to the rhythm of production structures.

Artists: [Fran Simó](https://fransimo.info/en/), [Francisca Trobok](https://franktrobok.com/), [Colectivo Fantasía Collage](https://www.instagram.com/fantasiacollage/)
