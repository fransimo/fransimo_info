More than **15 professionals from the art sector** will participate in **nine events** across different cultural centers in the city of Alicante. This is the core of **ppt Open Art Festival,** the first edition of a gathering aimed at presenting **new visions of contemporary art**.

Exhibitions, talks, and workshops covering topics such as **crypto art, sustainability, bio-art, and artificial intelligence** are at the heart of this new festival, created by the founders of [A Quemarropa residencies](https://www.informacion.es/cultura/2019/06/21/quemarropa-suspende-residencias-artisticas-despues-5386100.html) and [Piedra Papel Tijera ALC](https://www.informacion.es/cultura/2020/08/12/cinco-artistas-explicaran-obras-publico-8701120.html), **Juan Fuster, Miriam Martínez Guirao, and Ana Pastor**.

"The world is changing, and the festival seeks to highlight some of the currents that contemporary creators are addressing today, which may sometimes appear blurred due to the complex and turbulent moment that art is experiencing," say the organizers.
