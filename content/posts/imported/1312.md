Technology is commonly misunderstood. Is often associated to the "new phone I buy", but no one ever thinks about the technology involved in a toilet, or a spoon, and what huge difference this technologies created when it first come to daily life for a big proportion of population.

Humanity as spice based its survival in technology. Technology is the medium to conquer our world, to transform it in a human habitable space. From guns, fire, spoons, toilets, cars, computers to space shuttles it's always the same DNA code, to survy by constructing tools to transform something.

But we never though to much until the damage is done. We make "a" mistake and we have a global warming.

In a very simplified scheme technology has three eras: the spoon, the vapor and internet.

The spoon help us with a simple task improving our body just a little. The vapor make us travel every where improving our streng and speed, creating a global network for commerce. The computer improves our brain... this is real difference. A network of brain improvers is even more difference.

But what happens if this connected brain improvers start to learn and understand? Well... they already learn. The web-semantics developments will give them tools to start to understand.
