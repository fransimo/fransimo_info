Remember a factory... an early 20th century one. You may come up with some [Lewis W Hines iconic images](https://www.google.es/search?q=lewis+W+hines&espv=2&biw=1597&bih=864&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNivKmqLXJAhUF0RQKHRMSAzgQ_AUIBigB&dpr=0.9#tbm=isch&q=lewis+w+hines+factory).

We need to photograph our XXI factories. I capture the spaces where I work as software engineer.
