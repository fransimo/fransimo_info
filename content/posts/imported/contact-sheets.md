As part of my Artificial Intelligence research I made this contact sheets of the faces that the algorithm is finding. You can read more about my research [here](http://fransimo.info/?p=1100).  
You can also view the full contact sheets archive in [contacts](http://contact-sheets-idahb.fransimo.info/) or [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/93211492@N06/). The archive is updated every time the system find enough number of new faces.  
Note that every picture is credited, this is not appropriation of images on internet, it's re-use of freely distributed content interpreted my an AI algorithm.
