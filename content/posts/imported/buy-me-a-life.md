**Buy me a life! I'll use my energy to create art, help other artists, walk my spiritual path and share my knowledge.**

2501Îž is a tribute to Ghost in the Shell. Project 2501 was born in the net, he(\*) become alive as a pure digital being. The original authors of the code didn't intent to give him a life but "...life finds a way". I believe life is not restricted to carbon based lifeforms.

Is this a joke? No. My intention is not to be disrespectful with collectors or the NFT world. It's a social experiment where I'm the rat in the lab. You can always thing/dream about what will you do with an enormous amount of money coming from nothing but until it does not happen to you it's impossible to know. What will be the personal cost of this, even it's not sold? **...that's the point of my digital art: make you think!**
