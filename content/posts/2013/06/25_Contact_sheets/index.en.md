As part of my Artificial Intelligence research, I created these contact sheets of the faces that the algorithm detects.
You can read more about my research [here](/docs/art/new_media_art/I_dreamed_about_a_human_being/).

You can also view the full contact sheets archive on [contacts](http://contact-sheets-idahb.fransimo.info/)
or [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/93211492@N06/). The archive is updated every time the system finds
a sufficient number of new faces.

Note that every picture is credited. This is not the appropriation of images from the internet; it's the re-use of freely distributed
content interpreted by an AI algorithm.
